# TotalEmail Core

This is the start of something great!

**NOTE:** The code is this repository is missing some of the setting and configuration files required to get it working. It is not designed for anyone else to get it working on their own systems and this use-case is not supported. The code is simply open-sourced for transparency and out of necessity.

## Guidelines

### Git

Most of your work should be done on a branch with your name. In other words, Bob would work on a branch named `bob`. On occasions, code can be merged into the `dev` branch. Once code on the dev branch is well tested, it can be merged into `master` branch.

## Setup

### Docker (required)

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- To start the server: `docker-compose up`
- To run tests: `docker-compose run web pytest`
- To make migrations and migrate: `docker-compose run web python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `docker-compose run web python3 manage.py migrate` respectively
- To list running docker-compose services: `docker-compose ps`
- To shutdown a running server (ctrl+c will stop the server): `docker-compose down`

#### Using Alerta

To log errors to Alerta, you will also need to create environmental variables as follows (with valid data of course):

```shell
export ALERTA_KEY=1234567890987654321
export ALERTA_BASE_URL=https://192.168.0.0
```

### Postgres (required)

If you are running the vagrant box for the first time, you will need to install postgres. To do this, run the `./_meta/postgres_install.sh` script from inside the vagrant box.

Next, run `sudo -u postgres psql`, which logs you into the postgres user account so that you can create a database.

Now, enter the following commands:

```
CREATE DATABASE totalemail;
CREATE USER junkmailer WITH PASSWORD '1234567';

ALTER ROLE junkmailer SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE junkmailer SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE junkmailer SET timezone TO 'UTC';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE totalemail TO junkmailer;
\q
```

This will setup a database that Django can talk to.

### ToDo Review (recommended)

To make it easier to find todos, I recommend using [todo review](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TodoReview). If you already have this installed, you should also update your exclusions so that todo review doesn't look through the `test_emails` directory (assuming you have that created). To add an exclusion to todo-review, following the process here: https://github.com/jonathandelgado/SublimeTodoReview#excluding-files-and-folders. I just changed my default, todo-review settings, but you can change this to a custom format if you like.

### Mass Email Creation (optional)

To create a lot of emails in the system while it is running (which is helpful to test ui, ux, searching, etc..), follow the instructions below:

1. Copy the contents of `./test_resources/mass_email_creator.py`
2. In the command-line, run: `docker-compose run web python3 manage.py shell`
3. Paste the contents of `./test_resources/mass_email_creator.py` into the shell and you're good to go!

Notes:

- You can change the directory from which the emails are created in `./test_resources/mass_email_creator.py`.

### Heroku Deployment (optional)

To be able to deploy the app to Heroku, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and run:

```shell
git remote -v
heroku git:remote -a <NAME OF HEROKU APP>
git remote -v # you will now see that there is a git remote for heroku
```

You should only push updates to heroku from the master branch of the TE core repository. To push an update to heroku, use:

```shell
git push heroku master
```

You also need to add the Alerta key in heroku so that it is accessible in the app. To do this, update the commands below with the correct information and run:

```shell
heroku config:set ALERTA_KEY=1234567890987654321
heroku config:set ALERTA_BASE_URL=https://192.168.0.0
```

## Helpful Scripts

### Recreate the database

Delete and re-create the database:

```
DROP DATABASE totalemail;
CREATE DATABASE totalemail;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE totalemail TO junkmailer;
\q
```

#### Deploy to Heroku for the first time

When pushing to Heroku for the first time (if you have been testing it locally for a while), there are a couple of changes you will have to make. All of the steps below assume you are on the master branch. First, open `totalemail/settings.py` and find the section that says `DATABASES = {`. Comment out the section that is used for local testing (which is identified with a comment) and uncomment the section for heroku. Save and commit the changes. Now, you can run `git push heroku master` to push the updates to heroku.

Next, you need to make sure the db configuration on heroku is up to date. To do this, run:

```shell
heroku run python manage.py migrate
```

Assuming this finishes successfully, you are good to go!

### Viewing database tables

To view the structure of your database run:

```shell
psql
```

and then:

```
\dt
```

## Recipes

### Adding a New Analysis Engine

To add a new analysis engine:

- create a new file in the `analysis_server/engines` directory with the appropriate functions
- call the function and process the results from `analysis_server/analysis.py`
- Add an entry for the new source with the appropriate function to the `SOURCE_WEIGHTINGS` dictionary in `utility/utility.py`

## Common Errors

- `Missing staticfiles manifest entry for 'styles.css'`: run `make static`

## Misc.

### Color Codes

The color codes for the stop lights are:

- #6FEF87 - green
- #F1D86C - yellow
- #E64A48 - red
